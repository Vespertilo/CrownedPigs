# CrownedPigs
A tribute to the minecraft youtuber Technoblade.

In the past two days, I saw many posts urging Mojang to take action and add a tribute into the game for Technoblade. 
I have added two of the features that I saw most requested, a "Technoblade Never Dies!" splash text, and an easter egg when name-tagging pigs to the name "Technoblade".

## Features
>"Technoblade Never Dies!" random chance splash text.
